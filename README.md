# Green-Stock-Analysis
Background

Steve is a huge fan of the workbook I made for him. He has the ability to analyze a whole dataset with a single button click. He now wants to enlarge the dataset to encompass the entire stock market over the last five years in order to conduct some additional study for his parents. My code might not perform as well for thousands of stocks even while it functions fine for a dozen equities. And if it does, the execution phase might be prolonged.
To gather the same data that I did in this module, I will modify, or remodel, the Module 2 solution code to cycle through all the data once in this challenge. Next, I'll assess if the VBA script executed more quickly as a result of my code reworking efforts.
